# React Portfolio for Seth NeJame

This portfolio was designed to showcase the work and experience of junior software developer Seth NeJame.  The project was started as simple exercise for Week 3 of Craft Academy's full stack development bootcamp.  After the minimum requirements of the exercise were met, the portfolio was improved and deployed.
